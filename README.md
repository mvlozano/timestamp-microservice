# Timestamp Microservice

Timestamp Microservice project is a FreeCodeCamp Backend Challenge.
 Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice

 Note: Time zones conversion is not a purpose of this project, so assume all sent valid dates will be parsed with new Date() as GMT dates.
